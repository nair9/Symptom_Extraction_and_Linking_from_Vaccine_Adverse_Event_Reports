Patient developed a sore throat, intermittent headache, and fever at 5 days after the second dose of the vaccine, approximately one month after the first dose. Over the next few days, she continued to have persistent daily fevers of up to 40Â°C despite consistent use of acetaminophen and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. She subsequently developed severely debilitating myalgias,  arthralgias, and pleurisy that ultimately prompted her to seek medical attention. She was treated empirically with antibiotics for suspected community acquired  pneumonia and her hypoxia resolved within 24 hrs. On the second day of admission she  developed an evanescent salmon-colored rash over the upper back, dorsal aspect of the hands, and bilateral thighs occurring with fevers. Serological testing including rheumatoid factor, cyclic citrullinated peptide antibody IgG, and antinuclear antibody was negative. After a thorough unremarkable infectious and malignancy  work-up was completed, the patient was diagnosed with AOSD. At the time of diagnosis, according to the Yamaguchi classification criteria of AOSD, the patient met three of four major criteria (fever, typical rash, leukocytosis) and four of five minor criteria (sore throat, lymphadenopathy, abnormal liver function tests, and negative rheumatoid factor and antinuclear antibody).The patient started treatment with prednisone 60 mg daily (1 mg/kg per day) with immediate resolution of her fevers and skin rash, and rapid improvement of her arthralgias and myalgias over the subsequent 3 days. There was a worsening thrombocytosis for the first few  days after treatment initiation, which was deemed to be reactive and eventually improved with the rest of the inflammatory markers.

The patient received the second dose on 27 MAR 2021. She experienced a headache and a sore arm for day and a half after the vaccine. Then last week she also had a headache for two days in a row, but that could be due to the change in the weather, she doesn't know what that is. She said that a week and a half ago a rash, a measles like rash on her chest, arms and midriff developed. She wasn't sure if it was because she was working outside, or related to the vaccine. She did find a couple of ticks on her. She called the local farm bureau and they said no, it wasn't from the ticks because the ticks would of burrowed their head into the skin. It was probably because she was outside. The patient has been taking Benadryl do to the fact that she has been outside and she has been very itchy. Everything is in bloom right now, but she was wearing long pants and long sleeves with gloves. The patient's itching is horrible. The patient night before up all night took Benadryl. She got a cream her husband use to used for eczema, it was an anti-itch cream, and she also used Aveeno eczema cream that has calamine lotion in it. The patient hasn't gone and seen her doctor yet because she felt better two days later and thought it was subsiding. The patient might be because she takes a shower and then she is alright for a couple of hours because of all the creams she is using. The last night she was up till 3 am because of the itching. She stated that she knows you are not suppose to take other peoples medication but she had Prednisone 10 mg in the house, from her husband when he would have eczema flare ups, and she took that at 3 in the morning. She said that her doctor thought there has been too much time from when she got the vaccine for it to be related so she googled and it said that people can get a measles like rash, and read something about being on their toes, but hers wasn't on her toes. Her rash was just her chest, arm, part of her legs and midriff. She stated that she is nervous, and she lost her husband a year ago on 28 APR and she doesn't know, if it is just nerves/stress or if it due to the reaction. The patient when she went to go get the vaccine they had asked her if she ever had reaction to a vaccine and she said a year ago when she had the pneumonia shot, she got cellulitis 2 inches above and 2 inches below the injection site. Her doctor thought it was cellulitis and she had to take antibiotics for a week. She stated that she had to wait longer then the normal 15 minutes because of her previous reaction so they made he wait for 30 mins when she got the covid vaccine. The first shot did not hurt at all. She asked that because she said that the second vaccine hurt immediately, it was discomforting. She thought she hit a nerve. She said it was like someone ran a nail down all the way down to her elbow. She doesn't know if she hit a nerve or what, but it was very painful. Clarified her headache started Sunday night after the vaccine and went away Monday. The patient thought the rash might be shingles, but then she was like no, that is only suppose to be on one side of a body. She stated that she needs to get the new shingles shot because the one that she had years ago isn't good anymore. She hasn't had new shingles immunization yet because she had to get the COVID shot. She doesn't know if the itching started because she saw the ticks or not but it started immediately. She states that she got the ticks off of her and shook her hair out. She states that she took Benadryl, she didn't have the fast acting Benadryl she had the 24 hour relief Benadryl.

My brother had called 911 while I was out and an ambulance came within five minutes. The paramedics put me in the ambulance and took me to the hospital (they would have taken me to local except there was risk that it was a seizure, which I guess local isn't equipped to handle). They measured my vital signs, made IV ports in my arms and drew some blood. My blood pressure was super low and my heart rate was super high,  and I had a temperature of 102. When I got to the hospital they put two liters of saline drip into me to rehydrate me, did a CAT scan, and some bloodwork.

Syncopal event without evidence of seizure like activity, fast recovery, and no sudden changes consistent with an acute cardiac event.

He has no neurologic deficit, CTA thorax without PE, negative EKG, troponin and echocardiogram. He is not on antihypertensives and blood pressures have been normal. Given his initial diagnosis of BAC, there may be concern for metastatic disease, though symptoms have not persisted and he has no focal deficit. He also received contrast for his CTA today, thus will defer further imaging for now.   Syncope: - defer 2nd dose of COVID-19 vaccine as its effectiveness in transplant patient is not established and patient potentially had an adverse event.  - oral hydration encouraged - monitor for additional ongoing neurologic symptoms such as headaches, vision changes, neck stiffness, fevers, night sweats, weight loss, weakness or paraesthesias - patient advised to avoid driving until further evaluation - consider MRI brain with and without contrast if any symptoms persist or reoccur   Complex loculated pleural effusion\",\n",

For the third dose which they both got in the morning, in the middle of the night he got up to go to the rest room and he couldn\\'t move his legs from the waist down, which put her in a panic mode. When he woke up the next day he was fine. Then in Jul this year he had another Pfizer booster and had the same effects on the fourth one.

On January 15th, 2022, I received the Moderna booster vaccine (this was my third vaccination, I had previously received two Pfizer vaccinations in the summer of 2021). Immediately following the vaccination, I experienced, for the first time in my life, severe insomnia, sleep paralysis, hallucinations, and very vivid dreams. I have been battling these symptoms since January of this year. I have consistently, every night with no exception, multiple vivid dreams (in which I am sometimes fully aware I am lying in my bed while dreaming). I also consistently wake up every morning unrefreshed and tired, and experience excessive daytime sleepiness throughout the day. In summary, I haven't had a proper restorative night's sleep since receiving the Moderna vaccine.  The muscles around my left eye have begun to twitch recently (past 4 weeks) and partially squeeze my eye closed throughout the day. Needless to say, I am extremely suspicious that the Moderna vaccine caused this, since nothing else can explain this sudden onset of symptoms. I have never had any issues with my sleep before.
