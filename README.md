This repository contains the files of the project on Symptom Extraction and Linking from Vaccine Adverse Event Reports. The data is extracted from the VAERS data source here: https://vaers.hhs.gov/data/datasets.html.


1. Introduction
This project aims to develop an advanced system for extracting and linking symptoms from vaccine adverse event reports. Adverse event reports play a crucial role in vaccine safety monitoring, and the project seeks to enhance the efficiency and accuracy of this process. This proposal outlines the key components of the project, including objectives, methodologies, datasets, and anticipated outcomes.
Existing adverse event report analysis methods often rely on manual review, which is time-consuming and prone to errors. Automating this process can significantly improve the timeliness and accuracy of safety monitoring thereby aiding the regulatory authorities better.
The key goals involve the automation of symptom extraction from vaccine adverse event reports and the subsequent linking of these symptoms to specific vaccines, ultimately amplifying the efficiency and precision of the safety monitoring process.

1.1 Literature Review
In the realm of pharmacovigilance and public health, Symptom Extraction and Linking from Vaccine Adverse Event Reports (VAERs) stands as a crucial methodology designed to enhance the systematic analysis of adverse events following vaccination. This approach involves the extraction and identification of symptoms reported in VAERs, aiming to uncover potential patterns and associations between administered vaccines and adverse reactions. Leveraging advanced natural language processing (NLP) techniques, Symptom Extraction and Linking enables the systematic categorization and recognition of symptoms within the vast and varied textual content of adverse event reports. By establishing links between reported symptoms and specific vaccines, this methodology plays a pivotal role in the continuous monitoring and assessment of vaccine safety. The insights derived from Symptom Extraction and Linking contribute to the broader landscape of pharmacovigilance, offering valuable information for regulatory agencies, healthcare providers, and researchers to ensure the ongoing safety and efficacy of vaccination programs.
Numerous literatures have been written over the years regarding all thing’s natural language processing and artificial intelligence. Including all the papers from which every
algorithm stemmed is difficult and as such only the ones being directly used are being cited and explained here.
The first one being Stanza, an open-source Python natural language processing toolkit that supports 66 human languages. It features a language-agnostic fully neural pipeline for text analysis, which includes tokenization, multi-word token expansion, lemmatization, part-of-speech and morphological feature tagging, dependency parsing, and named entity recognition. The toolkit has been trained on a total of 112 datasets, including the Universal Dependencies treebanks and other multilingual corpora. The same neural architecture has been shown to generalize well and achieve competitive performance on all languages tested. Thus, proving to be a very useful package in this particular task [1].
Out of the plethora of embedding techniques that exist, BioSentVec is a pre-trained model that generates sentence embeddings for biomedical texts. It was created by applying sent2vec, an advanced unsupervised model, to both biological and clinical texts at a large scale. The model was trained with over 30 million documents from both scholarly articles in PubMed and clinical notes in the MIMIC-III Clinical Database. BioSentVec was evaluated in two sentence pair similarity tasks in different biomedical text genres. The benchmarking results demonstrate that BioSentVec embeddings can better capture sentence semantics compared to other competitive alternatives and achieve state-of-the-art performance in both tasks [3].
BioBERT stands out as a powerful pre-trained language representation model specifically tailored for the biomedical domain. Built upon the widely acclaimed BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) architecture, BioBERT undergoes pre-training on extensive biomedical corpora to learn contextualized word representations. Its training data encompasses diverse sources, including scientific articles from PubMed and clinical notes extracted from the MIMIC-III Clinical Database. The model exhibits a keen understanding of the intricate semantics within biomedical texts. Its versatility extends to fine-tuning for various downstream tasks, such as biomedical named entity recognition and text classification. BioBERT has demonstrated remarkable success in achieving state-of-the-art performance across a spectrum of biomedical natural language processing applications, marking it as a formidable choice for researchers and practitioners in the field [10].

1.2 Challenges
The VAERS dataset is very large and dealing with a vast dataset introduced challenges, particularly in managing its considerable size and intricacy. The main hurdle emerged during preparation and preprocessing, where the focus was on preventing data loss while handling diverse information across multiple CSV files. For this purpose, one vaccine was chosen from the vaccine data which was further used to shortlist a sample set of vaccine
adverse reports for further analysis. Also, it was ensured the sample size considered is considerably small in comparison to the size of the entire dataset. This ensured faster processing and prevented errors because of the data dimensions.
Due to the plethora of available models that are related to named entity recognition and natural language processing, in general, it is challenging to choose one model or approach that fits the task the best. Thus, in this study a similarity based matching is performed to link the extracted symptom entities. Despite processing only 10,000 reports out of the large dataset, the final steps of linking the extracted symptoms to the standard symptoms were quite difficult to deal with, in terms of processing times of up to days. This was eased by selecting only a sample set of most frequently appearing words for all the further processes.
Successfully addressing these challenges was crucial for maintaining data integrity and ensuring a solid foundation for subsequent analyses in this project.

1.3 Contributions
This project has made the following contributions to the task of symptom extraction and linking from vaccine adverse event reports :
• The project proposed an efficient dataset subset extraction method using simple data mining techniques. It focused on identifying vaccine types and performed a randomized but reproducible extraction of 10,000 reports, streamlining the process.
• The consolidated dataset is used to extract symptom-related entities from the sampled 10,000 reports using the stanza mimic package for named entity recognition in python.
• The extracted symptoms from the reports are then linked to the standard symptoms from the dataset using similarity-based matching employing the pre-trained model BioBERT, trained on biomedical and clinical data.
